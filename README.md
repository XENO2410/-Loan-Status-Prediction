# Loan Prediction System

This project implements a Loan Prediction System using Machine Learning with Python. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is utilized for prediction. Below is an overview of the project workflow and the libraries used.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to predict the approval status of loan applications using machine learning techniques. The system is built with the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Importing necessary libraries and the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Transforming and creating relevant features from the data.
4. **Model Training**: Training the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model on the processed data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the model using accuracy scores and other metrics.

## Libraries Used

- **numpy**: This library is used for numerical operations, providing support for arrays and matrices.
- **pandas**: A powerful data manipulation tool that helps with data analysis and cleaning.
- **sklearn.model_selection**: Helps in splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- **sklearn.svm**: Provides the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for prediction.
- **sklearn.metrics**: Used for evaluating the accuracy of the model and other performance metrics.

## Workflow

1. **Data Import and Exploration**: The dataset is imported, and initial exploration is conducted to understand its structure and content.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Normalizing numerical features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: 
   - Creating new features that could be relevant for the prediction.
   - Transforming existing features to improve model performance.
4. **Data Splitting**: 
   - Using `train_test_split` to divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. **Model Training**: 
   - Training the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model on the training data.
6. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Predicting on the test data and calculating the accuracy score and other relevant metrics.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict loan approval status. The use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) provides a robust framework for handling and analyzing the data.
